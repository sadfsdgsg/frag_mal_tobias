# frag_mal_tobias

We're just a bunch of guys experimenting with a ESP32 SX1276(LoRa) Module from Heltec HTIT WB32LAF wanting to somehow coordinate our cooperation.
Feel free to cooperate and/or criticise.

Our first idea is to capture BTLE beacons and somehow activate an intruder alert. This alert will be sent out via LoRa or WiFi (depends on what is available).
